                        <p>In a contested divorce, you and the other party disagree on at least one of the major divorce issues, including property division and 
                           child custody. When a divorce is contested, an experienced attorney can be brought in to provide caring advisement and dynamic 
                           negotiation. While you and the other party may not agree, our law firm does not see this as a barrier to you obtaining workable and 
                           successful results.</p>
